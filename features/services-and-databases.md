# Services & Databases

NativeDev's **Services & tools** page manages the native background services a typical PHP workstation needs, using the distro's own packages and systemd:

- Nginx
- MariaDB / MySQL (NativeDev installs MariaDB from your distro's repositories and shows the detected MariaDB version; it does not separately provision Oracle MySQL — one **MariaDB / MySQL** service card covers this role)
- PostgreSQL
- Redis Server + `redis-cli`, tracked as one component (`redis-server` + `redis-tools`)
- Memcached
- Composer
- mkcert + `libnss3-tools` (`certutil`) for local CA/browser trust

Every service that supports it gets start/stop/restart and enable/disable controls through systemd.


## Local HTTPS tooling

Installing **mkcert** from NativeDev also installs `libnss3-tools`, which provides `certutil`. NativeDev uses mkcert for the local CA and the `*.secure.<TLD>` certificate used by Local Development; `certutil` is required for the browser/NSS trust step.

The certificate is not created per project. One wildcard certificate covers `project.secure.<TLD>` hostnames, while normal local HTTP continues to use `project.<TLD>`. See [Local development](local-development.md) for the URL model and trust flow.

## Database accounts and credentials

After NativeDev installs MariaDB or PostgreSQL, it automatically provisions a database account named after your logged-in Unix user (for example `sayed`) with the default password `nativedev` — no second setup step is required. The Services page shows the managed server, port, username, and password with **Reveal**/**Copy** controls, plus **Change password** and **Reset to default** actions (**Reset** restores only the password back to `nativedev`, leaving the account and its data untouched).

Two adoption paths are offered if a matching account already exists:

- **Use existing user** — requires the current database password to match. NativeDev verifies it and stores the credential without changing the account's password. A mismatch changes nothing on the database side. Future Change/Reset actions are then self-service and do not need database-admin access again.
- **Use NativeDev default account** — never asks for the old password. It uses the privileged database-admin path to create or reset the current user's database account to password `nativedev`, then verifies that password before saving it.

NativeDev never silently overwrites a pre-existing, unmanaged database account matching your current Unix username during discovery/reconciliation, and legacy `nativedev`-named roles from an earlier model are left untouched.

Credential metadata is stored at `~/.config/nativedev/database-credentials.json` (mode `0600`); a full database uninstall removes that saved credential.

### Access model

- MySQL/MariaDB local access is granted development-appropriate privileges (database/schema/table/view/routine/trigger CRUD) without `GRANT OPTION` or user administration.
- PostgreSQL access uses `LOGIN CREATEDB` with `NOSUPERUSER NOCREATEROLE NOREPLICATION NOBYPASSRLS`.
- Connection cards show the conventional local endpoints `localhost:3306` and `localhost:5432`; NativeDev still uses explicit TCP internally when it needs to prove password authentication.

## Uninstalling a database

Database uninstall follows a conservative, APT-remove model by default: NativeDev stops/disables the service, removes the installed server/client package family, and forgets NativeDev's saved credential, while **preserving your database data and accounts**. The confirmation dialog has a default-unchecked **Delete all database data and accounts** option; enabling it additionally removes the default MariaDB data directory or PostgreSQL cluster data/config, so a later install starts from fresh accounts. Common/shared packages that other software might depend on are never purged or auto-removed as part of this.

Removal does not use an arbitrary short wall-clock timeout: APT runs non-interactively and is configured not to wait behind an already-busy dpkg lock, so a busy package manager is reported immediately rather than after a fixed delay, while a removal that actually starts is allowed to take as long as its package scripts legitimately need.

After a destructive PostgreSQL reset, NativeDev explicitly repairs the distro cluster lifecycle before provisioning accounts again: it creates/starts a `main` cluster if none exists, or starts the configured port-5432 cluster if it's down. This avoids ending up with PostgreSQL installed but unusable because no local socket is listening.
