# Developer Tools

![Developer Tools](/images/3.3-services-and-tools-phpmyadmin-adminer-adminersqlite-mailpit.webp)

Developer tools are persistent web-based utilities — phpMyAdmin and Adminer are the built-in examples — that NativeDev exposes on their own `*.localhost` addresses, separate from the project-based `*.test` routing described in [Local development](local-development.md).

## How they differ from projects

- Developer tools are configured in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/nativedev-tools.conf`, a file that is independent of your configured park directory or Local TLD. Changing those settings does not affect developer-tool routing.
- Each tool is bound to a specific PHP-FPM version rather than to a project. That binding is read dynamically each time NativeDev renders the tools' Nginx configuration or reports tool status, so it reflects whichever PHP versions are actually installed at that moment.
- If a tool's PHP-FPM version is no longer installed, the tool's server block is omitted from the rendered configuration rather than pointing at a socket that no longer exists.

## Selecting a PHP version per tool

Each developer tool has its own PHP-FPM version selector, independent of the system-wide CLI default and independent of any individual project's PHP dropdown.

## Uninstalling a PHP version that a tool depends on

Before uninstalling a PHP version, NativeDev simulates the removal (`apt-get -s remove`) against the packages that version owns. On Debian/Ubuntu, phpMyAdmin and Adminer packages depend on **generic, version-agnostic PHP packages** (for example `php-cli`, `php-mbstring`) that APT itself pins to one specific concrete PHP version at the package-dependency level — independent of NativeDev's own default-version setting. Removing that concrete version can therefore make APT propose removing phpMyAdmin/Adminer as a side effect of removing PHP, not because NativeDev's own tool-to-version binding says so.

NativeDev's uninstall safety check simulates the removal and identifies any **manually installed** package (such as `phpmyadmin` or `adminer`) that APT would remove alongside the requested PHP packages. If one is found, the uninstall is **blocked** rather than silently taking phpMyAdmin/Adminer down as an unannounced side effect of removing PHP, and NativeDev reports exactly which manually installed package(s) are at risk.

This currently means: uninstalling a PHP version that no developer tool depends on proceeds normally, while uninstalling a version a tool depends on is blocked with a clear message, even if another PHP version is already installed. To remove that PHP version, uninstall the affected developer tool(s) first, or keep the version installed. Automatically re-pointing phpMyAdmin/Adminer's underlying package dependency at a different installed PHP version before uninstalling is a possible future improvement, not current behavior — see [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md) for the exact message and today's workaround.
